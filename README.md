### Description:
This process takes an image, which is then converted into text and then finally converted into audio 

##Hardware:
* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - We recommend V3
* [Pi Camera](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/camera-board-for-raspberry-pi/) - Getting it to focus is hard. (We've broken 2 in the process of making it focus)
* Button - Can be any button. We used a simple button

##Software:
* [OCR-Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) 
* raspistill (raspberry pi Camera system)
* espeak (is normally already installed on most devices)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
